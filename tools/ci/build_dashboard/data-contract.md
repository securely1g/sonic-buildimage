# Build dashboard data (schema 1)

`collect.py` produces one JSON document, also used as its durable history. It
reads public GitHub Actions metadata only: no logs, artifacts, machine names,
workflow inputs, environment variables, credentials, or build execution.

- `schema_version`: `1`.
- `repository`: validated `owner/repository`.
- `generated_at`: UTC collection timestamp.
- `pull_requests`: current metadata, including closed and unmeasured PRs:
  `number`, `title`, `state`, `draft`, `url`, `head_sha`, `base_sha`,
  `head_branch`, `updated_at`, `merged_at`. These SHAs describe the **current PR
  metadata**, never the base/head that an old workflow tested.
- `runs`: one entry per `(run_id, attempt)`, retained after Actions history expires:
  `run_id`, `attempt`, `workflow_name`, `workflow_path`, `source_sha`, `branch`,
  `event`, `status`, `conclusion`, `pr_numbers`, `pr_association`, `pr_association_note`, `started_at`,
  `completed_at`, `updated_at`, `url`, `jobs`.
  `source_sha` is GitHub's run `head_sha`; it is not replaced by the current PR
  head. `pr_association` is `github` (run's explicit PR links), `commit` (exact
  current same-repository PR head), `branch` (unique same-repository feature
  branch, additionally verified through GitHub's commit-to-PR endpoint), or
  `none`. Multiple/ambiguous inferred matches are left unassociated.
  `pr_association_note` is normally `null`; it discloses HTTP 404/422 when an old
  commit cannot be resolved for optional PR inference. The run stays visible.
  Other optional commit-lookup failures are disclosed as temporarily unavailable
  and retried next refresh without refetching cached jobs. Main repository, PR,
  workflow, run-attempt, and job API failures still abort collection.
- Each job: `job_id`, `name`, `kind`, `architecture`, `status`, `conclusion`,
  `started_at`, `completed_at`, `duration_seconds`, `image_build_seconds`,
  `image_build_elapsed_seconds`, `phases`, `steps`, `url`.
  `kind`: `make-vs`, `bazel-vs`, `container`, `source`, `checks`, `other`.
  `architecture`: `amd64`, `arm64`, or `null`; the classifier only uses explicit
  job-name annotations, never the physical runner's identity.
  `phases`: keys `setup`, `build`, `validation`, `upload`, `other`, with summed
  completed-step seconds or `null` where there is no measured step. These are
  not guaranteed to partition job wall time (runner overhead is separate).
  `image_build_seconds` is populated only for successful, explicitly recognized
  image-build steps; `image_build_elapsed_seconds` also records a failed image
  build's elapsed time. A failed job is never a successful benchmark.
- Each step: `number`, `name`, `status`, `conclusion`, `started_at`,
  `completed_at`, `duration_seconds`, `phase`.
- `comparisons`: empty in this phase. API timing alone does not prove matched
  cache state, toolchain/configuration, hardware, or a historical tested base.
  Therefore no improvement or regression percentage is asserted.

Durations for skipped, incomplete, missing, malformed, placeholder, or reversed
start/end times are `null`, never a fabricated zero. Valid measured zero-second
steps are preserved. Concluded failed/cancelled jobs may have elapsed time;
consumers must use the outcome before plotting successful performance.

Only `bazel-swss-oci.yml`, `bazel-oci.yml`, and `bazel.yml` are collected. All
pages and run attempts are covered. Completed attempts are reused from history;
new, nonterminal, and changed latest attempts fetch current jobs. `--backfill`
forces a fresh read of every available attempt, including completed history. API failures
fail collection before replacing the output. Historical entries absent from
GitHub's response remain in history. Every URL is constructed on `github.com`
from the validated repository and integer identifiers.
